## General info
Who doesn't need a cool way to showcase what they're capable of and to display
some interesting projects? This site is meant to just that. 

The landing page is meant to draw in the user by simulating a terminal. Here they can 
watch scripts for each component be executed, install, render and complete. 

Next is the project section showing some of the projects I've enjoyed building. 
These are shown from the most recent to the oldest.
